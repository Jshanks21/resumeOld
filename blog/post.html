    <p>What's the difference between a digital marketer using Google to promote their business and a developer using
    Ethereum to host their project?</p>

    <p>Well, besides the fact that they're two extremely different industries trying to achieve different goals, one to
    share or promote and the other to build, it's their governance. In other words, it's the way that participants in
    each ecosystem influence the overarching network.</p>

    <p>The comparison in nature that inspired me to write this outlines the key differences I mean to highlight. Some of you
    might be familiar with the symbiotic relationship between sharks and remoras. Remoras attach themselves to sharks allowing
    them to feed on the shark's leftovers and any parasites living on the shark while hitching a free ride. In turn, the
    shark gets a free cleaning that benefits its overall health. The benefit to sharks may seem small, but they've been
    observed intentionally slowing down, even at their own risk, to pick up these hitchhikers. This suggests, the benefit is enough
    that sharks have evolved to recognize the benefits of a partner who can remove any surface parasites.</p>

    <p>This is how I view the relationship between Google and most digital marketers. You have a big animal that gets large
    chunks of meat and many smaller ones that feed on its scraps. They both benefit from their relationship though, unlike
    a parasitic relationship, where one suffers at the benefit of the other.</p>

    <p>To compare, Google is paid by most marketers to show their ads due to its overwhelming usage for internet searches.
    While marketers sell more than they would have without Google's ad services because of its massive search volume.</p>

    <p>Developers on Ethereum are more like ants in a colony. They are building something together for the benefit of the entire
    colony. There is a queen directing the colony, who can implement changes, but it's for the benefit of the entire system. If
    changes aren't acceptable, the colony can split, as some species of ants do.</p>

    <p>Core concept: small things building big things together. One big thing and many small things subsisting off each other.</p>
    <p>One grows, the other simply maintains.</p>
